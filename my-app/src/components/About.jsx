                    Hi, I'm <strong>Ramchandra Patade</strong> — a passionate Python Full-Stack Web Developer with a love for building elegant, efficient, and scalable web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in crafting seamless user experiences using modern tools and frameworks such as <strong>Django, Flask, React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</strong>, and RESTful APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I enjoy solving complex problems, writing clean and maintainable code, and continuously learning new technologies. Whether it's developing a responsive website, building a REST API, or deploying a full-stack application to the cloud, I'm all in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring open-source projects, reading tech blogs, or experimenting with automation scripts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I'm currently open to freelance work, full-time opportunities, or collaborations. Let’s connect and build something awesome!
                    </p>
